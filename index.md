Like LoL characters, but the game feels like a mobile game. Might give it one more try.

### Plan for today
- integrate diary
- push `why i like smalltalk - message protocols`
- think about artworks integration 
- plan for destiny thing with Wolfie

Played roblox with Joles, it went... okay
Man i love playing Oracle

I have my `posts` repo as gitsubmodule in `portfolio` repo and whenever I make a change in posts, I have to commit it twice, once in `post` & once in `portfolio`.
I just want to commit once and be done

Integrated Dark mode, ezpz

One of these days, need to plan about decoupling the submodules and building the site on push of any dependency repos

Oh hello git submodules

I did it, ahahah. I am a fucking god. I successfully tested GitHub actions trigger on push in submodule repo.

Easy day, dint really get much done. Pushed "Why I made a public diary" and made the diary. 

Need to clone the diary repo in GitHub workflow.
