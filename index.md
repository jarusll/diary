Like LoL characters, but the game feels like a mobile game. Might give it one more try.

### Plan for today
- integrate diary
- push `why i like smalltalk - message protocols`
- think about artworks integration 
- plan for destiny thing with Wolfie

Played roblox with Joles, it went... okay
Man i love playing Oracle
