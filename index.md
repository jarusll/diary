### Plan for today
- [ ] figure out data sources for d2newspaper
- [ ] do elisp koans
- [ ] watch system crafters

Came across `elcord-mode`, discord rich presense for emacs. Looks cool.
`recentf-mode`, remembers all the recent files. I am using it now.

Just found out about `describe-symbol` in emacs. It gives documentation about elisp symbols.

One thing that I really want to master in emacs is motions, moving around in buffer fast, really fast. Thats the thing I liked about Vim alot. If I can make it happen here, I won't need any vi emulation modes.

One of these days I'll draw the portal companion cube artwork. I got one online but it seems unethical. I'll make my own.

### Plan for today
- [x] setup `D2Newspaper`
- [x] fix posts github script
- [ ] setup git on android

The mount is here. Power tools are scary.
I have enough desk space now, I can use my drawing tablet. 
I set it up everything. I ll play Far Changing Tides, I've earned it.

I'll be messing around with emacs lisp for a while. My goal is to start talking in terms of emacs objects like buffers, windows & frames and then write some trivial macros.

Man I love magit, I am quickly able to do git actions which is letting me make rapid small changes. Good stuff.

I'll be trying out [elisp koans](https://github.com/jtmoulia/elisp-koans)
I did some elisp koans. I expected emacs types but this is standard lisp stuff. 
Anyways the youtube series by System Crafters should get me upto speed with emacs types.

I wanted to open my diary file quickly, I came across emacs registers. You can store any thing, good stuff. I stored my diary file at d. So I can access it by `C-x r j d` from anywhere in emacs. ezpz.

Easy day, pushed "What motivates me", started with elisp. System crafters should get me upto speed with Emacs.

Planned about d2newspaper. Lets make this happen.

### Plan for today
- [ ] setup `D2Newspaper`

There's alot of dust buildup in my pc, need to clean it. I ll do it when the mount arrives.

Wolfie talked about how he's missing reading books and now I want to readðŸ¥º. I will gain momentum first with short reads.

Pushed draft of "What motivates me"

Now that everything has been automated and decoupled, I can write articles on my phone. Need to find a good git app for Android.

Wolfie busy, we ll setup tomorrow.

Just realised I have misconfigured GitHub actions for posts and no listener for posts_push on portfolio. Will fix it tomorrow.

Absolutely not having chicken again.

Day rating - 5/10. My eyes were strained and I lost all dota matches but Charu cheered me up

### Plan for today
- [x] add site build trigger on `posts` push
- [x] integrate artworks
- [ ] push `why i like smalltalk - message protocols`
- [ ] add `` markdown highlights

Holy shit webp is good.
Just found out I can add ssh keys and I won't have to input password. VERY BIG, love it, my life is easy.

Its been a while since I had any day off, tomorrow is my day. No work tomorrow. I ll play dota and draw.

`The Green Knight` was the last decent movie I saw. I might watch some `Monty Python`. 

Me and Wolfie discussed about the Destiny thing(`D2Newspaper` for now). I'll be working on it with him.

Like LoL characters, but the game feels like a mobile game. Might give it one more try.

### Plan for today
- [x] integrate diary
- [ ] push `why i like smalltalk - message protocols`
- [x] think about artworks integration 
- [ ] plan for destiny thing with Wolfie

Played roblox with Joles, it went... okay.
Man i love playing Oracle

I have my `posts` repo as gitsubmodule in `portfolio` repo and whenever I make a change in posts, I have to commit it twice, once in `post` & once in `portfolio`.
I just want to commit once and be done

Integrated Dark mode, ezpz

One of these days, need to plan about decoupling the submodules and building the site on push of any dependency repos

Oh hello git submodules

I did it, ahahah. I am a fucking god. I successfully tested GitHub actions trigger on push in submodule repo.

Lets see if this works.

Yes it does, ahahahahahahaah.

Automated site build on submodule push. I did it for diary so I can write from phone, push and everything will just work. Tomorrow I'll do the same for posts

Good day, Charu cute, night friend

> Just let it crash and drop in debugger, we'll define things on the fly - *Some wise smalltalk programmer*

Easy day, dint really get much done. Pushed "Why I made a public diary" and made the diary. 

Need to clone the diary repo in GitHub workflow.
