`The Green Knight` was the last decent movie I saw. I might watch some `Monty Python`.

Played roblox with Joles, it went... okay.
Man i love playing Oracle

I have my `posts` repo as gitsubmodule in `portfolio` repo and whenever I make a change in posts, I have to commit it twice, once in `post` & once in `portfolio`.
I just want to commit once and be done

Integrated Dark mode, ezpz

One of these days, need to plan about decoupling the submodules and building the site on push of any dependency repos

Oh hello git submodules

I did it, ahahah. I am a fucking god. I successfully tested GitHub actions trigger on push in submodule repo.

Lets see if this works.

Yes it does, ahahahahahahaah.

Automated site build on submodule push. I did it for diary so I can write from phone, push and everything will just work. Tomorrow I'll do the same for posts

Good day, Charu cute, night friend
